**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, you will be able to **understand** the key features and advantages of FastAPI as a modern web framework for building APIs.

FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard [Python type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

## What is a web framework?

A web framework is a tool that simplifies the process of building web applications by providing common patterns, utilities, and structures for building out an application.

Frameworks like FastAPI make it easier to build feature-rich web applications without needing to start from scratch, allowing you to focus more on functionality rather than the highly technical, low-level details.

Web frameworks help developers handle tasks like:

- URL routing
- Processing requests and responses
- Efficiently managing application data
- Some frameworks also handle rendering webpage templates

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is known for its features and quality of life benefits for developers:

- Fast: Very high performance. One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
- Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
- Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

## What's next?

We will use FastAPI to build the classic _Hello World!_ server setup and with FastAPI takes just a few lines of codes.
